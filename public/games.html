            <p class="bg-gray-900">Sus clicker remastered, as 
                per the title name, is a remastered version of my 
                first game called "Sus clicker", sus clicker was a 
                little project I worked on during my time at 
                school, using the unity game engine. I would pump 
                out updates every week or so but due to the fact I 
                had only just started coding, my skills were very 
                limited, causing the game to become a terrible 
                mess, this lead to me creating the "big change" 
                will broke the balance of the entire game making 
                it beatable in like 12 minutes, undesirable. So 
                after about 6 months I found out about godot 
                engine and that's when my work begun (after I had 
                already made a few games with godot). The game 
                was supposed to be a little remaster, having 
                some of the shops from the original and all the 
                same features, and it still does, but the game 
                has a lot more new features, such as new shops, 
                new prestige systems and none of the old annoying 
                bugs, numbers in this game can also reach 
                infinity beacause of the godot big numbers 
                addon! This game is my pride and joy and I 
                love it dearly and if you play it, I hope you 
                love it too!</p>

                They call me blocky, a simple but not-so-simple game I made in the godot engine (shock) 
                but this game was made for the summer of making hosted by hackclub, the game features a terrible or good story (No-one has played it yet so IDK)
                where you are a block thing and you complete tests to uncover the
                mystery as to why you are completing these tests in the first place.
                It took me 52 hours to make it, not too long but, according to my friend,
                it is a great game nevertheless.
