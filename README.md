# Welcome to Bailey's website

This is my personal website that shows of my coding skills and gaming knowledge.

On this webpage expect to find code im good at, games that I enjoy playing and other things that I find interesting.

## What did I use to build this site?

This site is built using tailwind css and typescript + vite.
I have absolutely no experience in css let alone tailwind css, and before this I had never even heard of vite. Regarding typescript, well, I have a good knowledge of how javascript works and because of godot I know how to make sure things are typed so I imagine it will be a breeze!

Anyways, I hope you find my website acceptable. It won't be amazing as im learning as I create it.
